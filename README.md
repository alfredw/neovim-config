# Leaning Neovim

## Why?

I want to move back to vim as my main IDE and Neovim seems like a good candidate for that. Vim is still at it's core
but allows for a bit more flexiblity for customization. VSCode also has a Neovim plugin that integrates most of the
functionality of Neovim into VSCode instead of the VSCode Vim plugin which emulates vim within VSCode.

This is a big plus for me to learn and setup Neovim for my main editor of choice as it will allow me to have 
the best of both worlds.

## Copied from LunarVim

All of this is copied from LunarVim git repository. There maybe changes for my personal preferences later 
but this repo was a great source for learning and his YouTube videos on his explanations

## Why didn't you just copy LunarVim's Repo?

I find I learn better by implementing rather than just straight up copying
